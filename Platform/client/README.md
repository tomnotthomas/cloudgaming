# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Swiff Frontend

Welcome to the setup guide for Swiff, your go-to app for gaming integration and management. Follow these steps to get your frontend up and running smoothly.

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Acquire API Keys ðŸ”‘

#### RAWG API Key
To display game data, first get your RAWG API key:
[RAWG API Documentation](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

#### Steam Web API Key
Get your Steam Web API key here:
[Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
*Note: You need at least one paid game in your Steam account to request a Steam Web API key.

### Step 2: Steam Game Account ðŸŽ®
If you don't already have a Steam account, set one up to test the complete workflow:
[Create Steam Account](https://store.steampowered.com/)
*Tip: Add some games to your new account, or use your existing Steam account for authentication within the app.

## Installation and Setup

1. To install the required dependencies, run `npm install` from the client, server and react-website folders.

2. Create a `.env` file in the client folder and add the following variables:
REACT_APP_RAWG_API_KEY

3. Run `npm start` from the client folder to start the client. The project will now be running at http://localhost:3000.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\


4. `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
