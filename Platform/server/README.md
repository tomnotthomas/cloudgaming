- **Enable Compute Engine API**: Necessary for creating virtual machines/gaming computers.
- **Enable NVIDIA GAMING PC in GCP Marketplace**: Specifically, select the Windows Server 2019 option.

### Step 4: Configure and Deploy Your Gaming Machine 🎲
- **Increase GPU Quotas**: Adjust the GPU limits for regions where you'll deploy gaming machines.
- **Use the NVIDIA GAMING PC Image**: From the GCP marketplace, select the Windows Server 2019 image.
  - Upgrade the Windows server image to at least 300GB of hard drive space.
  - Remotely connect (RDP) into the machine.
  - Install Steam and Parsec.
  - For low latency streaming with Sunshine and Moonlight, ensure hardware compatibility. Note: Windows Server 2019 may not be supported.

### Step 5: Create a Machine Image 🖼️
- After setup, create a machine image from your VM. Right-click on the machine in the console and select "Create machine image".

### Step 6: Link Your Machine Image to the Project Repo 🔗
- In the project repository, navigate to `server/src/helpers/instance-resource-template`.
- Replace the `sourceMachineImage` link with your newly created machine image.

### Step 7: Integrate with VSCode and Cloud Code 🧑‍💻
- Connect your VSCode to Google Cloud using the Cloud Code add-in.
- Grant it permissions to create, delete, and update VMs.

Now, you should be fully equipped to deploy and manage your gaming machines in Google Cloud!
